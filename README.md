### General Information / Behind the scenes.

Sacrilege jam was a tough call, Re:Mobilized while im also part of the main mod team, it’s a challenge to come up with an idea to create something fun and compelling, Re:Mobilized and progs_dump per se are mods i thank to this day that exist, Sacrilege has cool features i’ve been looking for so i jumped on the Sacrilege jam ship.


The music track was something i had always in my mind, for the core idea i didn’t want to make a dark synthwave song for it, Phoenyx allowed me to use her track in a Quake map and i thought this was it, i had a bit of inspiration and creative flow lock but after seeing Rift texture i realized that can be an interesting premise, a Water distillation facility and there we go : Rifting Distillation came to fruition.


For this map i recolored some textures from the id base texture pack included within Sacrilege, to make Neon lights, something i’ve been looking forward to do for a while… I’m starting to explore my skills in photo editing with GiMP


Also i started using Control Sectors (Control areas) that are outside of the playable area, there are 2 sectors that were made to test the Minlight and the neon lights textures with the surface value in the lights.


Shademaster brought up some custom enemy mini-boss for the maps in the jam, i included the models for it, since every other setting is in the sacjam mod folder.


A fun fact i wanted to tell about : i was planning to include in Quake Re:visions jam in my Corrupted Keep map (Disrupted Keep) a boss fight against Goroth, since boss fights weren’t exactly a part of the scope of Re:Mobilized i changed the map structure a bit making Chthon the boss fight for that map… Sacrilege has Goroth as a boss monster, i planned to use it but i thought maybe in another map to use it, since i’m happy with how the map turned out to be.

Another interesting fact is that the music by Phoenyx was used in 1x1 Doom wad in map 14 (also made by her), if you check a playthrough of the map it emphasizes using neon red lights in a dark space… While both ideas for my map and her have coincidences : I’ve never played this map or seen it prior to making Rifting Distillation, both maps focusing on strong Neon Lights surrouding the area (altho her map only uses Red lines).

The trampolines were an after-thought, i left them in a layer in case i needed them out of the map quickly but after playtesting i realized they were a good addition to the map.

Shademaster helped me a lot with ideas for the map (the fountain, ambient noises and the mini-boss fight) thanks and shoutout for you!

A final piece of trivia : The map didn't have any "bounce", i usually set it up to 1 but "things happen for a reason", i tried using bounce 1 but the map looked WAAAY too bright, and there was a small softlock possibility with the boots, i did some testing and got to fix it... while also doing my own verifications that the map had no big softlock.

Thank you for playing my map, it was fun making it, best wishes for all of you! Keep reaching for the stars!
